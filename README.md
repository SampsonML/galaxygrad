# GalaxyGrad
Package for a score-based diffusion model trained on HSC galaxies, and ZTF like simulations.
See https://pypi.org/project/galaxygrad/0.1.5/
Contains 4 generative diffusion models {HSC, ZTF}_ScoreNet32 and {HSC, ZTF}ScoreNet64 for both the HSC and ZTF surveys. These are used to return the gradients of an arbitrary image with respect to a prior distribution of individual artifact free galaxy models. Current functions include {HSC, ZTF}_ScoreNet{32, 64}(image) returns gradients w,r,t the trained prior of the image. Data transformatons are handled internally so that all returned gradients are in standard observation space (i.e not log space etc).

Install the package from pip

```shell
pip install galaxygrad
```
You can now use the pre-loaded priors on and 2D arrays the same size as the numerical value of the prior name, ie HSC_ScoreNet64 takes 64 by 64 arrays.

```python
# load in the model you wish to use
from galaxygrad import HSC_ScoreNet64
prior = HSC_ScoreNet64

galaxy = np.ones([64,64])
gradients = prior(galaxy)
```

For adjusting the temperature of the model the cleanest way is to instantiate a prior class and call the prior through this
```python
# define a class for temperature adjustable prior
class TempScore(ScorePrior):
    """Temperature adjustable ScorePrior"""
    def __init__(self, model, temp=0.02):
        self.model = model
        self.temp = temp
    def __call__(self, x):
        return self.model(x, t=self.temp)
```
Now you may call the prior through the class with any custom temperature between 0 --> 10, though nothing above 0.1 would be reccomended.
```python
temp = 0.02
prior = TempScore(model=HSC_ScoreNet64, temp=temp) 
```

Of course you can also directly state the desired temperature each time too
```python
# load in the model you wish to use
galaxy = np.ones([64,64])
gradients = HSC_ScoreNet64(galaxy,t=0.05)
```
This previous method tends to be cleaner when working with optimisation schemes and taking gradients of the prior (if desired)
